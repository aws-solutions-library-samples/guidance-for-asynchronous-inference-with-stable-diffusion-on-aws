# Guidance for Asynchronous Inference with Stable Diffusion on AWS

Implementing a fast scaling and low cost Stable Diffusion inference solution with serverless and containers on AWS

[Stable Diffusion](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/stable-diffusion/) is a popular open source project for generating images using Generative AI. Building a scalable and cost efficient Machine Learning (ML) Inference solution is a common challenge that many AWS customers are facing.
This project shows how to use serverless architcture and container services to build an end-to-end low cost, rapidly scaling asyncronous image generation architecture. This repo contains the sample code and CDK deployment scripts that will help you to deploy this solution in a few steps.

## Features

- Asyncronous API and [Serverless Event-Driven Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/event-driven-architectures.html)
- Image Generation with open source Stable Diffusion runtimes running on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)
- Automatic [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queue length based scaling with [KEDA](https://keda.sh/)
- Automatic provisioning of EC2 instances for Amazon EKS compute Nodes with [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/)
- Scaling up new Amazon EKS nodes within 2 minutes to run Inference tasks
- Saving up to 70% with [AWS GPU](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) spot EC2 instances

### Architecture steps

1. An application sends the prompt to [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) that acts as an endpoint for the overall Guidance, including authentication. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function validates the requests, publishes them to the designated [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) (Amazon SNS) topic, and immediately returns a response.
2. Amazon SNS publishes the message to [Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) (Amazon SQS) queues. Each message contains a Stable Diffusion (SD) runtime name attribute and will be delivered to the queues with matching SD runtime.
3. In the [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS) cluster, the previously deployed open source [Kubernetes Event Driven Auto-Scaler (KEDA)](https://keda.sh) scales up new pods to process the incoming messages from SQS model processing queues.
4. In the Amazon EKS cluster, the previously deployed open source Kubernetes auto-scaler, [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh), launches new compute nodes based on GPU [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (Amazon EC2) instances (such as g4, g5, and p4) to schedule pending pods. The instances use pre-cached SD Runtime images and are based on [Bottlerocket OS](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) for fast boot. The instance can be launched with on-demand or [spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot) pricing model.
5. Stable Diffusion Runtimes load ML model files from [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (Amazon S3) via [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI Driver](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3-csi-driver) on runtime initialization or on demand.
6. Queue agents (software component created for this Guidance) receive messages from SQS model processing queues and convert them to inputs for SD Runtime APIs calls.
7. Queue agents call SD Runtime APIs, receive and decode responses, and save the generated images to designated Amazon S3 buckets.
8. Queue agents send notifications to the designated SNS topic from the pods,  user receives notifications from SNS and can access images in S3 buckets.

### Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of April 2024, the cost for running this
Guidance with the default settings in the US West (Oregon) is approximately for one month and generating one million images would cost approximately **$436.72** as illustrated in the two sample tables below (excluding free tiers).

We recommend creating a [budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-create.html) through [AWS Cost Explorer](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to help monitor and manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this Guidance.

The main services and their pricing for usage related to the number of images are listed below (per one million images):

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and
controls the components, including host operating systems, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in
which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

### IAM Roles
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles allow AWS customers to assign granular access policies and permissions to AWS services and users in the cloud.

This guidance creates separate IAM roles and grants permissions for the following components:
1. Amazon EKS cluster, including
  * Creating and operating the cluster
  * Compute node groups
  * Nodes created by Karpenter
  * Pods running in the cluster, including
    * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karpenter
    * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KEDA
    * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluent Bit
    * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stable Diffusion runtimes
2. AWS Lambda functions
3. Amazon API Gateway

This guidance uses IAM roles for internal user access control, following the principle of least privilege, ensuring that each component can only access authorized components and maintaining application workload isolation.
