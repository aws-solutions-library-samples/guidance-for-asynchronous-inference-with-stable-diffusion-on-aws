# Guidance for Asynchronous Inference with Stable Diffusion Web UI on AWS

Implementing a fast scaling and low cost Stable Diffusion inference solution with serverless and containers on AWS

[AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is a popular open source project for generating images using Gen AI. Building a scalable and cost efficient inference solution is a common challenge AWS customers facing. This guidance shows how to use serverless and container services, such as Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and Amazon EKS to build an end-to-end low cost and fast scaling asyncronous image generation architecture. This repo contains the sample code and CDK deployment scripts, helping customers to deploy this solution in a few steps.
